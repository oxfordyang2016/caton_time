The next step is to emphasize crosssensory
feedback. Involving one extra
sense is a good first step; now involve several
other senses and allow them to interact.
Suppose you take the design and do a couple of things to it:
• Write it down in your usual form.
• Draw a picture (not UML or an official diagram; just a picture).
What visual metaphor is appropriate?
• Describe it verbally.
• Engage in open discussion with your teammates; respond to
questions and criticisms, and so on

feedback is a very effective way of increasing understanding
and retention
